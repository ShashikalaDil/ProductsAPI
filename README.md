.NET Core RESTful API with Code First Approach (Using .NET 6)

## Description

This project is a learning exercise focused on building a RESTful API using .NET Core with a Code First approach. It leverages the features of .NET 6 for efficient development. The API will perform CRUD operations.

## Prerequisites

- Visual Studio 2022
- .NET 6 SDK

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Visual Studio 2022.
3. Restore the required NuGet packages.
4. Build the solution.

## Usage

1. Launch the application from Visual Studio.
2. The API will be accessible at `http://localhost:<PORT>/api`.
3. Use a tool like Postman or a web browser to interact with the API.

## Code First Approach

This project follows a Code First approach, meaning the database schema will be generated based on the entity models defined in the code.

## CRUD Operations

- **Create:** Use HTTP POST method to add new resources.
- **Read:** Use HTTP GET method to retrieve resources.
- **Update:** Use HTTP PUT or PATCH methods to modify existing resources.
- **Delete:** Use HTTP DELETE method to remove resources.

## Learning Purpose

This project is primarily for learning purposes. It serves as a practical exercise for understanding the implementation of a RESTful API using .NET Core with a Code First approach.
